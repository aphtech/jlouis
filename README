JLouis by Michael Whapples: A set of java bindings for liblouis
===============================================================

Introduction
============

JLouis is a set of bindings for the liblouis Braille translator. Liblouis
can be found at http://liblouis.googlecode.com.

Licensing
=========
JLouis is written by Michael Whapples and is released under the Apache 2.0
license. A copy of the apache 2.0 license should have been included with the
software, so for details of what is permitted please see the file LICENSE.

As the apache 2.0 license allows modified versions to be created and 
distributed, the original author of JLouis wishes to only be represented 
by the original JLouis distribution which can be found at http://bitbucket.org/mwhapples/jlouis/

Installation
============
JLouis is built using the apache maven tool. If building JLouis from source,
visit http://maven.apache.org to obtain and install maven.

When you have maven installed, then follow the instructions below to build 
JLouis.

1. Download JLouis from http://bitbucket.org/mwhapples/jlouis
2. If you downloaded JLouis in an archive file, unpack it.
3. In the jlouis directory, run the command mvn package

Once you have done this you should find two jar files in the target 
subdirectory. One of these jar files contains jlouis with all its dependencies 
and the other only contains jlouis.

Problems when using/compiling
=============================
JLouis does not include a copy of liblouis, therefore you must have liblouis 
installed on your system. Even if you have liblouis installed, it may still 
be possible that JLouis still cannot find your liblouis installation. In this 
case, you can specify where the library file (eg. dll on windows, so file 
on linux, etc) is to be found by using the java system property 
jlouis.library.path. In this system property just specify the path, do not 
specify the library file itself.
